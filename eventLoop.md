# Event Loop in JavaScript

The Event Loop is a key part of how JavaScript's asynchronous behavior is managed. It involves the interaction between the Call Stack, the Callback Queue, and the Event Loop itself.

Here's a visual representation of how it works:

```
1. Call Stack (JS Execution Context)
   |
   |  ----> setTimeout function (Web API)
   |          |
   |          |  ----> Timer starts
   |          |
   |          |  ----> Timer ends
   |          |
   |          |  ----> Callback function enqueued in Callback Queue
   |
   |  ----> Event Loop
               |
               |  ----> Checks if Call Stack is empty
               |
               |  ----> If empty, takes the first function from Callback Queue and pushes it to Call Stack
               |
               |  ----> Call Stack executes the function
```

## How it works

1. The `setTimeout` function is called in the JavaScript code, which is handled by the Call Stack.
2. The `setTimeout` function is then passed to the Web API provided by the browser, which starts the timer.
3. Once the timer ends, the callback function is enqueued in the Callback Queue.
4. The Event Loop constantly checks if the Call Stack is empty.
5. Once the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop takes the first function from the Callback Queue and pushes it to the Call Stack.
6. The Call Stack then executes the function.

## Key Components

- **Call Stack**: This is where JavaScript executes functions from. It follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, meaning the last function that gets in is the first one to be executed.

- **Callback Queue**: Also known as the task queue or the event queue. When an asynchronous event occurs (like a timer completing, a mouse click, an HTTP request finishing, etc.), the callback function associated with that event is placed into the callback queue.

- **Event Loop**: This is the mechanism that checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, it takes the first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack to be executed.

## setTimeout method

`setTimeout` is a Web API provided by the browser that JavaScript can use to interact with the web environment. It's not part of the JavaScript language itself, but is provided by the browser environment in which JavaScript runs.

When you call `setTimeout`, the browser starts a timer in the background. Once the timer ends, the browser places the callback function you provided to `setTimeout` into the Callback Queue. The Event Loop, which is constantly checking if the Call Stack is empty, will then take this function and place it onto the Call Stack to be executed.

## Commonly Used Web APIs

1. `setTimeout` and `setInterval`: These methods allow you to schedule functions to run after a set amount of time, or at regular intervals.
2. `fetch`: This method is used to make HTTP requests to retrieve data from a server.
3. `addEventListener`: This method is used to handle events such as clicks, key presses, etc.
4. `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`: These APIs allow you to store data in the user's browser that persists even after the browser is closed (localStorage) or only for the duration of the session (sessionStorage).
5. `requestAnimationFrame`: This method is used for creating smooth animations.
6. `navigator.geolocation`: This API is used to get the geographical location of the user.
7. `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`: These methods are used to select elements from the DOM.
8. `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`: These methods are part of the History API and are used to manipulate the browser history.
9. `new WebSocket`: This constructor is used to create a new WebSocket connection for real-time communication between the client and server.
10. `new Worker`: This constructor is used to create a new Web Worker, which allows you to run JavaScript in the background on a separate thread.

Remember, these are just a few examples. There are many more Web APIs available in modern browsers.
